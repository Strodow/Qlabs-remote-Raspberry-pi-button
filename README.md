## Qlabs-remote-Raspberry-pi-button

This program is made for a specific use, but it should work well as a base if you are getting started using OSC with Qlab.
If you are interested in its use we have a computer running Qlab in the back of the room and on stage an actor needs to push a doorbell. In order to get the timing perfect I am using an raspberry pi zero connected to a doorbell button, when pushed it tells Qlab to play a specific cue.

### Qlab communication

If you want to quickly see how it connects:

```markdown
import OSC


while 1:
	a = raw_input("press enter to execute cue:")
	client = OSC.OSCClient()
	msg = OSC.OSCMessage()
	msg.setAddress("/cue/"+ a +"/start") # "/cue/1/start"
	client.sendto(msg, ('192.168.100.17', 53000))

```
