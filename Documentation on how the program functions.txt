Documentation on how the program functions.txt
Writen in Python



------
Libraries in use:
pyOSC (compat with python 2.x)

------
So Qlabs can use 3 methods for remotely controlling the program:
- OSC messages, which use the Open Sound Control protocol; a flexible, extensible, network-based messaging system designed as 		a sort of successor to MIDI.
- QLab messages, which use a subset of OSC to send QLab-specific commands.
- UDP messages, which send plain text as UDP packets.

------
This program uses OSC and the reference documentation on the commands that Qlabs listens for are here:
https://figure53.com/docs/qlab/v4/scripting/osc-dictionary-v4/

------
The network side of this:
Qlabs will listen on port 53000 and send on port 53001 UDP.
*Note Qlabs also listens for plain text on port 53535 UDP.
The raspberry pi will use the library to send osc data to port 53000



------------------
Version 0.1
- The Program will run on a raspberry pi sending on port 53000 and listening on port 53001 UDP
- The program will send /cue/{cue_number}/start
